                I'm a dedicated full stack engineer that loves to build things with a real impact. I'm a Junior majoring in CS at UW, minoring in Data Science and Business.
                Some highlights of my work include developing REV's mobile app and raising $65,000 for Seattle Children's Hospital as the President of the Bubble Bash Guild.
                I am currently interning with Huddle Fantasy Sports, a member of DubHacks Next Cohort 4, and will be joining USAA as a SWE Intern this summer.
                I'd love to connect, feel free to reach out!
